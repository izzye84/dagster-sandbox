We’re Kevin and Daryl from Certainly Health (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certainlyhealth.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certainlyhealth.com&#x2F;</a>), a marketplace that lets you shop for doctors and compare your out-of-pocket costs upfront (currently only in NYC). Using each patient&#x27;s insurance and machine learning, we predict and guarantee out-of-pocket costs to prevent surprise bills.<p>We grew up in immigrant families, and for both of us, our parents would honestly tell us to not trust doctors because of unexpected medical bills. They really believed that doctors were adding on unnecessary things that didn’t help in order to make more money. As adults, we’ve both had first-hand experiences receiving surprise bills even with good insurance while working at tech companies, so solving this problem is personal to us.<p>It turns out 38% of Americans delay medical care for fear of the bill while prices vary 2-10x across health providers, even when using insurance. This led us to believe that creating a marketplace with transparent out-of-pocket costs could be a solution.<p>However, it wasn’t until the July 2022 Transparency in Coverage Rule (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cms.gov&#x2F;healthplan-price-transparency"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cms.gov&#x2F;healthplan-price-transparency</a>) that we had the payer pricing data (that’s actually high quality compared to hospital data) to create this marketplace. Certainly is the first company to use this data to predict and guarantee prices for consumers to book doctors.<p>We know the HN community has been interested in applications of healthcare price transparency data (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32738783"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32738783</a>), so we’re excited to share how we’re using this data to predict and guarantee prices for a consumer application.<p>With Certainly, patients can enter their insurance, compare guaranteed out-of-pocket costs across doctors, and book an appointment with price transparency. For providers, we guarantee any patient we send them will always pay. Partner providers pay us any time we send them a new patient. Eventually, we’ll convert providers to using our SaaS platform to guarantee payments from existing patients.<p>We are currently focused on shoppable services - anything that can be scheduled in advance.
Our solution falls between two ends of the spectrum for consumer shopping experiences. At one end is healthcare, where the status quo is you go to a doctor and you have no idea what will happen and you have no idea how much it will cost. At the other end is going to a restaurant, having a menu of items with corresponding prices, and deciding which items you want to order.<p>Certainly Health lets you see what services could happen during your visit and how much they will cost. We guarantee that if those services happen, you will not pay more than the out-of-pocket costs you saw upfront for each of those services. But it is ultimately the doctor who decides which services you end up getting (like a chef deciding which dishes you will be served). As a result, you can compare upfront out-of-pocket costs specific to your insurance and book a provider without worrying about surprise bills.<p>A common misconception is that patient out-of-pocket costs are set by doctors. Prices of healthcare services are actually the result of negotiations between providers and insurance companies. Groups with more negotiating power, like large hospital systems, are able to command higher rates than private practice physicians. This variance in cost is enormous across almost all procedures we&#x27;ve looked at, even between providers a few blocks from each other. It might cost $105 to get an orthopedic consultation with one doctor, and $550 to get a consultation with another doctor across the street, for example. This price variance means the out-of-pocket cost also varies for patients with high deductible plans or plans where the copay does not cover all services (which we’ve encountered very often).<p>We do not use hospital price data which is inconsistent and messy (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;health-costs&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;analysis-inconsistencies-within-hospital-price-transparency-data-make-cost-comparisons-difficult&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;health-costs&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;analysis-inco...</a>). Instead, our guaranteed prices are based on three things: (1) health insurance published rates for procedures, as required by regulation; (2) patient eligibility&#x2F;benefits information (e.g. deductible, copay, coinsurance); and (3) an online learning model to account for variance across thousands of plans and patient conditions.<p>As we process payments and claims, we create an accurate platform for predicting out-of-pocket costs by accounting for variations such as whether certain procedures are covered by an insurance plan&#x2F;copay, and how the rate changes based on diagnosis code (we discovered V97.33XD is for &quot;Sucked into jet engine, subsequent encounter”), number of units, medical coding modifiers, and other factors.<p>Certainly is currently available in NYC where you can choose from over 5k doctors to book without surprise bills for free at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certainlyhealth.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certainlyhealth.com&#x2F;</a>. We plan to expand to other cities once we prove that we can establish a low CAC on both the supply and demand sides in NYC.<p>Although we’re early, we’re starting to see intended results. One patient saved $850 on a podiatrist visit booked through us compared to a previous visit with a different doctor for the exact same services. Another was charged for an annual physical, but we identified the mistake and got a refund issued to him. Most of our customers have had surprise bills in the past and are happy to have peace of mind with our upfront, guaranteed prices.<p>We’d love to hear your ideas, experiences, feedback and any feature requests!"

I recently had the idea of using Llama2 to use common sense reasoning and subject level expertise to correct transcription errors in a &quot;smart&quot; way-- basically doing what a human proofreader who is familiar with the topic might do.<p>I came up with the linked script that takes a PDF as input, runs Tesseract on it to get an initial text extraction, and then feeds this sentence-by-sentence to Llama2, first to correct mistakes, and then again on the corrected text to format it as markdown where possible.
This was surprisingly easier than I initially expected thanks to the very nice tooling now available in libraries such as llama-cpp-python, langchain, and pytesseract. But the big issue I was encountering was that Llama2 wasn&#x27;t just correcting the text it was given-- it was also hallucinating a LOT of totally new sentences that didn&#x27;t appear in the original text at all (some of these new sentences used words which never appeared elsewhere in the original text).<p>I figured this would be pretty simple to filter out using fuzzy string matching-- basically check all the sentences in the LLM corrected text and filter out sentences that are very different from any sentences in the original OCRed text. To my surprise, this approach worked very poorly. In fact, lots of other similar tweaks, including using bag-of-words and the spacy NLP library in various ways (spacy worked very poorly in everything I tried).<p>Finally I realized that I had a good solution staring me in the face: Llama2. I realized I could get sentence level vector embeddings straight from Llama2 using langchain. So I did that, getting embeddings for each sentence in the raw OCRed text and the LLM corrected text, and then computed the cosine similarity of each sentence in the LLM corrected text against all sentences in the raw OCRed text. If no sentences match in the raw OCRed text, then that sentence has a good chance of being hallucinated.<p>In order to save the user from having to experiment with various thresholds, I saved the computed embeddings to an SQLite database so they only had to be computed once, and then tried several thresholds, comparing the length of the filtered LLM corrected text to the raw OCRed text; if things worked right, these texts should be roughly the same length. So as soon as the filtered length dips below the raw OCRed text length, it backtracks and uses the previous threshold as the final selected threshold.<p>Anyway, if you have some very old scanned documents laying around, you might try them out and see how well it works for you. Do note that it&#x27;s extremely slow, but you can leave it overnight and maybe the next day you&#x27;ll have your finished text, which is better than nothing! I feel like this could be useful for sites like the Internet Archive-- I&#x27;ve found their OCR results to be extremely poor for older documents.<p>I&#x27;m very open to any ideas or suggestions you might have. I threw this together in a couple days and know that it can certainly be improved in various ways. One idea that I thought might be fun would be to make this work with a Ray cluster, sending a different page of the document to each of the workers in the cluster to do it all at the same time."

Use the CMS &#x2F; Framework &#x2F; SSG of your choice.<p>- Strong focus on interoperability with DOM-altering JS tools (think Alpine.js, jQuery, ...).<p>- Strong focus on accessibility, even for fragment visits.<p>## Long Version: Best of three worlds<p>Hi, I&#x27;m Rasso Hilber. I have been a web designer and developer since around 2004. From the beginning of my career, I always had to make tradeoffs between 3 goals when building websites:<p>1. The websites I build should be visually impressive, original, and snappy.<p>2. The websites I build should be crawlable, accessible and standards compliant.<p>3. The websites I build should have low technical complexity and be easy to maintain in the long run.<p>In the beginning, I was able to achieve goals 1 (impressive!) and 3 (easy to maintain!) by using Macromedia&#x2F;Adobe Flash, but due to the nature of the technology horribly failed to deliver crawlable and accessible websites. Later, I found a way to run two sites in parallel for each website I built, one using CMS-generated XHTML for crawlability, one in Flash for the visitors, fetching the data from its XHTML twin. Now I had solved goals 1 and 2, but my setup was awfully complex and brittle.<p>Around 2010, I was relieved to see Flash finally coming to its end. I switched to building websites using PHP, HTML, and jQuery. I could now tick goals 2 (accessibility) and 3 (low complexity), but the websites I was able to build using these technologies weren&#x27;t as impressive anymore. Hard page loads between every link click being one of the biggest regressions in UX from the days of Flash IMO.<p>Around 2014&#x2F;15, I first heard about the new frameworks: Angular, React, Vue. These frameworks were not intended to be used for classic websites. They were made for single-page-apps! But it felt to me like no one cared. Even when building classic websites, many developers sacrificed SEO and accessibility for a snappy experience, serving an empty `&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;` to the browser. I couldn&#x27;t blame them; I had done the same in my early days as a Flash developer. They ticked goal 1 (impressive) and goal 3 (low complexity). But the lack of accessibility kept me from joining the movement. I was still building classic websites, after all.<p>After some time, many started realizing that serving an empty div had downsides – SSR, hydration, and whatnot were born, now ticking goal 1 (impressive) and goal 2 (accessibility), with the trade-off of awful complexity. It reminded me a lot of my little Frankenstein&#x27;s monster &quot;Flash+XHTML,&quot; and I still didn&#x27;t want to join the hype.<p>Still, because the noise was so loud, I felt like I might be becoming obsolete, an &quot;old man yelling at the clouds&quot;.<p>New very interesting tools like HTMX or Unpoly popped up that looked promising at first, but at closer inspection weren&#x27;t optimized for my use case either. These were primarily built for real interfaces&#x2F;single-page-apps (html snippets instead of full pages, UI state independent of URLs, altered DOM saved in history snapshots, ...). I wanted to find a <i>tiny</i> tool, optimized for building <i>presentational</i>, <i>content-driven</i> websites with a strong focus on <i>accessibility</i>.<p>Instead, after a few years of rolling my own home-grown solutions, I started using swup[0], a &quot;Versatile and extensible page transition library for server-rendered websites&quot;. Swup consists of a tiny core and a rich ecosystem of official plugins[1] for additional functionality. It was hitting the sweet spot between simplicity and complexity, and felt like it was perfect for my use cases. Shortly after I had started using it, I became a core contributor and maintainer of swup.<p>The only thing I was still missing to be a happy developer was the ability to create really complex navigation paths where selected fragments are updated as you navigate a site, much like nested routes allow in React or Vue.<p>The last two months I teamed up with @daun [2] to finally solve this hard problem. The result is two things:<p>1. A new major release of swup (v4) that allows customizing the complete page transition process by providing a powerful hook system and a mutable visit object
2. The newly released fragment-plugin [3] that provides a declarative API for dynamically replacing containers based on rules<p>Use cases for the fragment-plugin are:<p>- a filter UI that live-updates its list of results on every interaction<p>- a detail overlay that shows on top of the currently open content<p>- a tab group that updates only itself when selecting one of the tabs<p>- a form that updates only itself upon submission<p>I can now finally build websites that tick all three boxes:<p>1. Visually impressive, fun, and snappy by using swup&#x27;s first-class support for animations[4], cache[5], and preload capacities[6], enhanced with fragment visits as seen on the demo site.<p>2. Accessible by being able to serve server-rendered semantic markup that will fully work even with JavaScript disabled (try it out on the demo site!). On top of that, swup&#x27;s a11y plugin[7] will automatically announce page visits to assistive technologies and will focus the new `&lt;main&gt;` element after each visit.<p>3. Because now all I need for my fancy frontend is a bit of progressive JavaScript, I can choose whatever tool I like on the server, keeping complexity low and maintainability high. I can use SSGs like eleventy or Astro (the demo site is built using Astro!), I can use any CMS like WordPress or ProcessWire, or a framework like Laravel. And I don&#x27;t have to maintain an additional node server for SSG!<p>The plugin is still in it&#x27;s early stages, but I have a good feeling that this finally is the right path for me as a web developer. All it took was 20 years! ;)<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swup&#x2F;swup"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swup&#x2F;swup</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;plugins"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;plugins</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daun"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daun</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swup&#x2F;fragment-plugin"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swup&#x2F;fragment-plugin</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;how-it-works&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;how-it-works&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;cache&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;cache&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;preload-plugin&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;preload-plugin&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;a11y-plugin&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swup.js.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;a11y-plugin&#x2F;</a>"

We&#x27;re Nick, Patrick, Philip, Sebastian, Sven, and Timo from Titap (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiptap.dev&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiptap.dev&#x2F;</a>), an open source developer toolkit for building collaborative editing apps. Our editor framework, based on ProseMirror, is at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ueberdosis&#x2F;tiptap"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ueberdosis&#x2F;tiptap</a>, and our real-time collaboration backend, based on Yjs, is at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ueberdosis&#x2F;hocuspocus"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ueberdosis&#x2F;hocuspocus</a>.<p>Building editor interfaces like Notion or Google Docs in your web app takes a lot of work and time. Our open source tools and cloud services let you build collaborative content editing faster—in days or weeks, rather than months or years. And this is just for the editor. If you want real-time collaboration or other advanced features like version history in your editor, the overall workload quickly escalates—you will need a robust and serious backend infrastructure that requires even more time to set up and maintain. This doesn’t make sense for most frontend developers or most startups.<p>We spent eight years as a digital agency developing applications with complex content editing functionality. We learned the hard way how limited the existing editors were. After building Tiptap as a headless editor framework with an extension-based architecture, we needed to allow multiple users to edit content simultaneously, which got complicated. There was no simple solution that could be integrated quickly. So we built that too.<p>The Tiptap editor is based on the JS framework ProseMirror, which is a good foundation for editors. The learning curve for ProseMirror is steep because it&#x27;s complicated to understand and lacks simple APIs and documentation. It takes a lot of code around ProseMirror to develop a modern user experience. We’ve taken care of that for you.<p>Tiptap is headless, so it will work with whatever frontend or design you have in mind—we make no assumptions about your UI. You can use it to develop block-based editors like Notion, classic interfaces like Google Docs, or whatever you need. It&#x27;s also framework agnostic, so you can use it with React, Vue, etc., or vanilla JavaScript. And it&#x27;s highly customizable through our extension architecture. We also provide an API to access ProseMirror&#x27;s internals through Tiptap if you want to dig deep into the core.<p>Adding real-time collaboration to your editor is as easy as installing and configuring an extension. Our collaboration backend, called Hocuspocus, uses Yjs. This is a widely used implementation of CRDTs (conflict- free replicated data type). Hocuspocus makes it easy to set up a Node.js websocket server to handle communication between multiple peers to synchronize data. Like the Tiptap editor, Hocuspocus is designed to be extensible according to your needs. Also, Hocuspocus can work independently of Tiptap with other editors like Lexical or Slate.<p>An earlier version of Tiptap got discussed a couple years ago at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26901975"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26901975</a>. We’ve been enjoying wider adoption since then. For example, Substack uses Tiptap for their editor that allows creators to write content on substack.com, and YC uses Tiptap in their Bookface forum (which is basically HN for YC alums).<p>With the Tiptap Cloud, we offer managed backend services if you don&#x27;t want to build and maintain every feature yourself. For real-time collaboration, we provide a cloud infrastructure with multiple datacenter regions where you can deploy Hocuspocus. The Tiptap AI integration beta is a service where you connect your OpenAI API key to our backend and install the Tiptap editor AI extension to get AI writing experience in your editor. Here’s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai-demo.tiptap.dev&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai-demo.tiptap.dev&#x2F;</a><p>We invite you to explore Tiptap&#x27;s capabilities in your app, contribute to its open source development, and (hopefully!) join our welcoming community.

This app was borne out of my own frustration. I thought that I was terrible at learning languages at school, since I didn&#x27;t become conversational in French after 5 years of study. However, I later traveled with some French friends and, in just under 3 weeks, I was able to hold a reasonable conversation. I realized that there&#x27;s no substitute for speaking to native speakers.<p>I tried to adopt this approach for other languages, but it&#x27;s much harder to find people to practise with when you aren&#x27;t travelling. I started using iTalki to meet people from different countries and chat to them. It quickly became very expensive and time-consuming to schedule the calls, so I gave up.<p>I made PrettyPolly so that anyone can easily practice speaking 26 languages orally. The app uses ChatGPT (amongst other tools) to allow you to practice speaking whenever you want. It also generates a fluency score for each conversation so that you have an objective way of tracking progress.<p>It&#x27;s free to use (up to 15 conversations per month). I&#x27;ve found that using it once or twice per day is plenty, and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much you will pick up in a week. I&#x27;ve added some FAQs here in case useful - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prettypolly.app&#x2F;learn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prettypolly.app&#x2F;learn</a><p>Would really appreciate any feedback. Let me know if you have any questions, issues or suggestions.<p>Thanks,
